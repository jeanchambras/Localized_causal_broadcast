Project of the distributed algorithms class

## Test for submission

To test the code for the first submission

1. copy test files from `tests` directory to directory :`/38` 

         cp project_code/tests/* 38   
        
2. go to directory `38`

        cd 38
        
3. start the test script
        
        ./validate.sh FIFO JAVA
        
4. done

> note that the validate script simulate loss and delays in the network configuration (sudo required). Better to test inside the VM
